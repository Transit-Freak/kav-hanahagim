# Development migration using GitHub Pages

User confirmed 2026-09-14: this is still development; retain GitHub Pages and do not require a new server.

- Map background: Protomaps regional OSM-derived static vector tiles, extracted from the 2026-09-13 archive, bbox 34.2,29.4,35.95,33.5, zoom 0–14. Higher display zoom uses overzoomed vector geometry. This is a dated snapshot, not live road updates.
- Build: GitHub Actions downloads only the regional subset, exports uncompressed XYZ files and hosts them with the site. Browsers never hotlink the planet archive or call CARTO, Esri or a public routing demo.
- Map renderer: MapLibre GL JS with the Leaflet binding; existing route, stops, recentering and driver overlays remain Leaflet objects. Light/dark styles use Hebrew labels. Satellite mode is removed.
- Prepared navigation data continue to load from the project's existing feed. Pages cannot run a live OSRM process. Manually uploaded GTFS has no automatic live routing fallback without an explicitly configured endpoint; this must remain visible as partial/unavailable instructions.
- The map export was locally measured at 23,937 tiles, 120,615,422 bytes, before code/font assets. The deployment checks total size below 900 MB. Pages has a 1 GB site limit and a 100 GB/month soft traffic limit; this is not an unlimited-scale commitment.
- No new server, paid plan, API account, or age-restricted hosted map service is required.

The workflow first builds a Pages artifact on the migration branch without replacing the live site. Merge only after the map and Hebrew labels are verified. A Pages deployment setting may need to select GitHub Actions if the existing site still enforces branch-only builds; do not report deployment success until the live URL is checked.

Licensing policy and intended-use checks remain mandatory. This migration resolves identified map-service dependencies, not all legal questions. GTFS feed-specific rights, speech voice provider terms and original application license remain unresolved. The site does not add driver tracking; infrastructure request logs are distinct and must not be described as nonexistent.
